Review Comments:

1. Game: The best features of the code are that each function is well separated,
and each of them is basically well-documented.
2. Game: It does follow the Java code conventions, and the code style is consistent as well.
3. Game: 473~492 Maybe more annotations in the lines will be better
4. Game: 191~196 The code there is redundant, which can be replaced by the function (InvalidMoveNotice())
5. Game: 214~220 Maybe a judgement can be added, when the winner comes out, no more invalidMoveNotice is needed,
or the notice can overlap with the winning notice.
