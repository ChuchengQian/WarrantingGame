I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method getSupporters (String setup, String moveSequence, int numPlayers, int playerId )
* This function is to get supporters, which is a basic function for the game.
* it can be used in Task 8, 9, 11.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <...> came from a discussion with <...>

* The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
